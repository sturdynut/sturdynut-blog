Amy Hoy wrote a book called ["Just Fucking Ship"](https://shop.stackingthebricks.com/just-fucking-ship) and it hooked me as soon as I started reading it.

I found that it was speaking directly to me, as I have really struggled to ship many ideas.  Maybe you have too?  If so, definitely go read the book.  In
the meantime, I wanted to share some of my own struggles and how I have used some of Amy's techniques to help me ship an app.

# My struggle

- I have been working on shipping an app for about 3 years.
- I have re-written it several times.
- No end in sight
- No sense of urgency
- No clear direction

I'm sure you have been there too.  Taking time in the evenings and weekends just working away on your "app".  Never shipping it.

# Set a Deadline

I do not like deadlines, but they have their place.  I like to think of them as finish lines and there can be more than one!

However, if you do not have any, then any sense of direction and urgency is lost.  So, you must be willing to draw lines in the sand, make sacrifices and deliver something that might not have fit your initial vision.

# Scoping ideas

I get this feeling when I start working on a new project.  It's like the feeling you get when you see big, open blue skies.  It feels really good and exciting and it's where great ideas come from.  However, without some sort of boundary, it is literally boundless.  So, how do you have your "feel goods" and ship shit too?

The blue sky just needs some

More often than not I will get excited about an idea and just run with it.  However, there is no finish line or direction, just aimless running.

Can you imagine if that is how we all ran our software projects?  No scope what-so-ever? _The horror_ ðŸ™€

By thinking about the end product, it forces me to create boundaries around the idea which essential is the scope of the work.  By knowing what the scope of the work is, it can then be broken down into parts.

# Why is it so hard to ship shit?

These are the top three reasons why I struggle to ship shit:

1) Procrastination - Like many of us, I say I will do this thing, but end up simply not doing it.
2) Spread too thing - Also, like many of us, I take on too many things and do much but complete little.
3) Life - You can plan all you want, but life has a way of getting in the way.

# What I found to help

I'm not going to go through every technique here, you can just read the book for that, but I wanted to share what I found to be the most helpful and the formula I developed that was
inspired by these techniques.

## Working backwards

I get really excited about new ideas, but unfortunately I do not always see it through to the end.  This results in poor planning and a kinda of aimless approach.
By crystallizing my final product I can work backwards from there.  This simple exercise is so powerful for me.

It's cool to have a neat idea, but what **exactly** will you be delivering?
