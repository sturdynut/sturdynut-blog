## Welcome
Now a days as a front-end developer, in order to stay relevant we must deal with a constantly changing and evolving ecosystem of technology and devices.

I find myself constantly reading articles, pocketing articles to read, skimming my twitter feed and perusing source code on github to see how the legends are coding.

My hope is that I can capture what I am currently learning and share the knowledge.
