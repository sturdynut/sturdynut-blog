> In the programming world it is tradition to output the message "Hello World" when writing your first program.  This is my "Hello World" post.

# Not Easy
I have been paralyzed with the swells of information and frameworks.  It is constant and never ending.
I grew up a "front-end developer", which basically meant I wrote code and also knew css.

## A little about me
![Young Matti](/images/01-young-matti.jpg){: .left-rounded-image }

I started working at a [technology company](http://www.oeconnection.com) a couple weeks after I graduated high school.  I spent nearly 5 years learning many aspects of software development, from quality assurance, building and deployment strategies to writing automated tests and eventually software.
Fast forward another 5 years and here I am.
Throughout the past decade I have worked with a wide variety of software development cultures and paradigms.  I've also worked as a classic W2 employee, to an independent consultant to business owner.  I hope to draw on these experiences to provide more meaningful and applicable posts to your day-to-day.

### I have found my place in the nebulous of UX.

More and more companies are pushing for "UX" and yet, many companies still struggle with implementing a great user experience.

#### What is coming?

It is my hope to distill "UX", topic by topic.  You can expect future posts to be focused on UX, UI patterns and software development culture and methodologies.
