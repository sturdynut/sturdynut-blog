## History

_Since the rise of the internet, laying out web sites had been done using various means_

### Framesets and HTML Tables

These were the bane of many web developers' existence because of a multitude of reasons that are well covered elsewhere (<a href='http://lmgtfy.com/?q=why+do+framesets+and+html+tables+suck%3F' target='_blank'>LMGTFY</a>).  Let's just be happy you can forget about them and let's move on.

### CSS

Things did get better.  After many years of epic and brutal wars trying to get `<frameset></frameset>` and `<table></table>` to succumb to our will and work in all browsers, the brave and fearless web developers simply had enough and said "NO MORE!".

Actually **CSS** became a viable option for layouts, because of the introduction of element positioning and z-index.  This was originally proposed back in 1997 by the W3C, later replaced by CSS 2.1...blah blah.  Read more <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets' target='_blank'>here</a>!

Just as a throw-back, remember this? <a href='http://www.csszengarden.com' target='_blank'>www.csszengarden.com</a>

### A Brighter Future

So, without further ado...let's talk about the hotness that is Flexbox.

<small>_In the distance, the sad panda sheds a tear of pure flexbox joy..._</small>

## What is Flexbox?

At a high level, flexbox is a new layout intended for complex applications and webpages.

> Flexbox is a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can “flex” their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/' target='_blank'>https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/</a>

So, if you can imagine your flexbox container as one of those <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=pez+candy&tbm=isch' target='_blank'>PEZ containers</a>, your flex items are the tasty, little candy treats inside.  By default, those tasty treats flow in the direction of the pez container and are constrained to the container, but you have control over much of this, as we will learn.

#### Key Features

* Content can flow in any direction (left, right, down or up)
* Displayed order can be reversed or given a specific order
* Content can be laid out across the main axis or the cross axis.
* Content can grow or shrink to accomodate available space.
* Content can be aligned in respect to the their container or their siblings.
* Content can be dynamically collapsed or uncollapsed along the main axis while preserving the containers cross size.

#### Key Terms

* There is a **flex container** and it has **flex items**
* There is a **main axis** and a **cross axis**
* There is a **main start** and a **main end**
* There is a **cross start** and a **cross end**
* There is a **main size** and a **cross size**

### Flex Container

A flexbox container can be used as block-level or inline.

```
.block-level-flex-container {
  display: flex;
}

.inline-flex-container {
  display: inline-flex;
}
```

#### Alignment

There are 3 ways to control alignment of flex items.

* `justify-content` - How flex items align along the main axis.  For now, think `text-align`
* `align-content` - Just like `justify-content`, but only for flex items that wrap.
* `align-items` - How flex items align along the cross axis.  For now, think `vertical-align`

##### justify-content

Aligns items along the main axis of the flex container.

![image](/images/posts/flexbox/flex-box-justify-content.svg)

##### align-items

Aligns items along the cross axis of the flex container.

![image](/images/posts/flexbox/flex-box-align-items.svg)

##### align-content

Aligns content when flex-container wraps.  Note:  This only makes sense to use when you also use `flex-wrap: wrap` or `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse`

![image](/images/posts/flexbox/flex-box-align-content.svg)

#### Ordering and Orientation

Flex items can flow up, down, left or right.  They can also stay on one line or wrap to multiple lines.

* `flex-direction` - Controls direction of flow.
* `flex-wrap` - Should flex items stay on one line or wrap to multiple lines?
* `flex-flow` - Shorthand for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`, i.e. `flex-flow: column wrap`

*Accessibility Tip:  Always keep the order in your HTML correct.  Use the `order` and `flex-flow/flex-direction` to change this visually.*

##### flex-direction

Controls the direction of the flow along the main axis.  For each of the values below, imagine we are working on an xy axis.

* `flex-direction: row` - x axis, left to right
* `flex-direction: row-reverse` - x axis, right to left
* `flex-direction: column` - y axis, top to bottom
* `flex-direction: column-reverse` - y axis, bottom to top

##### flex-wrap

Controls whether items will wrap or not.

* `flex-wrap: wrap` - items will wrap.
* `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse` -  items will wrap and stack in reverse order.
* `flex-wrap: no-wrap` - items will not wrap and will bleed outside of the container.

*flex-wrap will respect languages that are left-to-right or right-to-left.  #winning*

##### flex-flow

Shorthand for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`.

* `flex-flow: row`
* `flex-flow: column wrap`
* `flex-flow: row-reverse wrap-reverse`

### Flex Items

The direct descendants of your flex container are your flex items.

_The exception is text without a tag, i.e. `Just some text` vs `<span>I'm a flex item</span>`._

**Example**

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="QNReor" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="sturdynut" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut/pen/QNReor/">Flexbox Examples - Flex items</a> by Matti Salokangas (<a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut">@sturdynut</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

#### Flex Item Alignment

Flex items can override the `align-items` property of it's flex container by using `align-self`.

##### align-self

Sometimes you want a specific flex item to behave differently than the rules set on the flex container.

`align-self` is the same as `align-items` but is just for a specific flex item.

#### Flex Item Flexibility

Depending on the size of the flex container, flex items can grow, shrink and also have a minimum width/height (depending on `flex-direction`).

* `flex-grow`
* `flex-shrink`
* `flex-basis`

> The defining aspect of flex layout is the ability to make the flex items “flex”, altering their width/height to fill the available space in the main dimension. This is done with the flex property.  <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flexibility' target='_blank'>https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flexibility</a>

##### flex-grow

Determines how a flex item will grow relative to the other flex items in the container when there is additional space to distribute.

**Example**
<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="LNKEBP" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="sturdynut" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut/pen/LNKEBP/">Flexbox Examples - flex-grow</a> by Matti Salokangas (<a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut">@sturdynut</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

##### flex-shrink

Determines how a flex item will shrink relative to the other flex items in the container when there is additional space to distribute.  Flex-shrink is calculated by multiplying the flex-shrink value by the flex-basis (auto by default) when distributing negative space.

**Example**
<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="qZzEMW" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="sturdynut" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut/pen/qZzEMW/">Flexbox Examples - flex-shrink</a> by Matti Salokangas (<a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut">@sturdynut</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

##### flex-basis

Sets the initial size of the flex item prior to flex-grow and/or flex-shrink being applied.

**Example**
<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="VaJYVv" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="sturdynut" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut/pen/VaJYVv/">Flexbox Examples - flex-basis</a> by Matti Salokangas (<a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut">@sturdynut</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

##### flex

Shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`.

`flex: [flex-grow] [flex-shrink] [flex-basis]`

**Example**

* `flex: initial`, equivolent to `flex: 0 1 auto;`
* `flex: auto`, equivolent to `flex: 1 1 auto;`
* `flex: none`, equivolent to `flex: 0 0 auto;`
* `flex: [positive-number]`, equivolent to `flex: [positive-number] 1 0`

#### Flex Item Ordering, Z-Index and Visibility

##### order

* Flex items are ordered by the `order` modifier in place or the raw document order.

**Examples**

The items below would be displayed in reverse.

```
.item-1 {
  order: 3;
}
.item-2 {
  order: 2;
}
.item-3 {
  order: 1;
}
```
.item-3 would always be the first since it has a lower order than the default value of 0

```
.item-1 {
}
.item-2 {
}
.item-3 {
  order: -1;
}
```

##### z-index

* Z-index values will stack elements even if position is `static`.

##### collapse

* `visibility: collapse` will collapse a flex item affecting the containers main size, but will have no effect on the cross axis.

**Umm...WAT?**

This means that if you collapse a flex-item the width doesn't change, so it isn't jumpy.  However, `visibility: collapse` is expensive, so only use it when you need it.

#### Margins and Padding

* Margins of adjacent items do not collapse.
* Percentage margins and paddings should be avoided as they will get different behavior in different browsers.
* Auto margins expand to absorb extra space, which is awesome because you can use auto margins for alignment or to push items apart.

#### Minimum Size

A new value `auto` is now used as the initial value for `min-width` and `min-height`.  This provides an intuitive experience because your flex items will fit to the flex container by default.

#### Tips

There are some nuances of Flexbox you should be aware of, if you are accustomed to using `display: block`.

* `column-*` for multi-column layouts have no effect on a flex container.
* `float` and `clear` will not work
* `vertical-align` will not work
* `::first-line` and `::first-letter` will not work
