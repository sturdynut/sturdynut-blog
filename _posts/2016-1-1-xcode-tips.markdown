### Multiple Cursors

One of my favorite features of sublime text is `cmd+d` to multi-select.
Unfortunately, xcode does not have this out of the box.

**Change a variable name in a given scope**

1. Highlight some text
2. `control + command + e`

**Quickly cycle through instances of a string**

1. Highlight some text
2. `command + e`
3. `command + g`
4. Repeat step 3 for each instance.

### Move a Line Up or Down

Another favorite shortcut from Sublime is `cmd + control + up or down`.  Xcode has this too. :)

**Move a line up or down**

1.  Highlight a line
2.  `cmd + option + [` for up or `cmd + option + ]` for down
