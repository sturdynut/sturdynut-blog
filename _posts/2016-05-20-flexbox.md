## History

_Since the rise of the internet, laying out web sites had been done using various means_

### Framesets and HTML Tables

These were the bane of many web developers existence because of a multitude of reasons, which are not really relevant anymore, so just be happy you can forget about `<frameset></frameset>` and only use `<table></table>` for showing data, not for layouts.

### Div + CSS

After many years of epic and brutal wars trying to get `<frameset></frameset>` and `<table></table>` to succumb to our will and work in all browsers we had enough.  Well, technically **CSS** finally became a viable option for layout in conjunction with our good ol' `<div></div>`, because we had browser support.

Just as a throw-back, remember this? [http://www.csszengarden.com/](http://www.csszengarden.com/)

### A Brighter Future

Despite the CSS revolution, we were still struggling with laying out pages, especially with the shift to mobile-first and responsive design using `float: left` or `position: absolute` became a nightmare unless you were the Bruce Lee of CSS.  Sure, it worked, but was it fun?  Not really.

Since the inception of Flexbox there has been 3 versions.  Yup, 3.  If you care, you can read more about it on [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/old-flexbox-and-new-flexbox/)

So, without further ado....let's talk about the official version of Flexbox.

<small>_In the distance, a sad panda just shed a tear of pure flexbox joy..._</small>

## What is Flexbox?

At a high level, flexbox is a new layout intended for complex applications and webpages.  The W3C describes Flexbox as follows:

> Flexbox is a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can “flex” their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.

#### Key Features

* Content can flow in any direction (left, right, down or up)
* Displayed order can be reversed or given a specific order
* Content can be laid out across the main axis or the cross axis.
* Content can grow or shrink to accomodate available space.
* Content can be aligned in respect to the their container or their siblings.
* Content can be dynamically collapsed or uncollapsed along the main axis while preserving the containers cross size.

#### Key Terms

* There is a **flex container** and it has **flex items**
* There is a **main axis** and a **cross axis**
* There is a **main start** and a **main end**
* There is a **cross start** and a **cross end**
* There is a **main size** and a **cross size**

### Flex Container

A flexbox container can be used as block-level or inline.

```
.block-level-flex-container {
  display: flex;
}

.inline-flex-container {
  display: inline-flex;
}
```

#### Alignment

After flex items have been sized according to their flex-basis, flex-grow and flex-shrink they can be aligned along the main and/or cross axis.

##### justify-content

Aligns items along the main axis of the flex container.

![image](/images/posts/flexbox/flex-box-justify-content.svg)

##### align-items

Aligns items along the cross axis of the flex container.

![image](/images/posts/flexbox/flex-box-align-items.svg)

##### align-content

Aligns content when flex-container wraps.  Note:  This only makes sense to use when you also use `flex-wrap: wrap` or `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse`

#### Ordering and Orientation

Flex items can flow up, down, left or right.  You can also specifically set the order for each flex item.

*Accessibility Tip:  Always keep the order in your HTML correct.  Use the `order` and `flex-flow/flex-direction` to change this visually.*

##### flex-direction

Controls the direction of the flow along the main axis.  For each of the values below, imagine we are working on an xy axis.

* `flex-direction: row` - x axis, left to right
* `flex-direction: row-reverse` - x axis, right to left
* `flex-direction: column` - y axis, top to bottom
* `flex-direction: column-reverse` - y axis, bottom to top

##### flex-wrap

Controls whether items will wrap or not.

* `flex-wrap: wrap` - items will wrap.
* `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse` -  items will wrap and stack in reverse order.
* `flex-wrap: no-wrap` - items will not wrap and will bleed outside of the container.

*flex-wrap will respect languages that are left-to-right or right-to-left.  #winning*

##### flex-flow

Shorthand for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`.

* `flex-flow: row`
* `flex-flow: column wrap`
* `flex-flow: row-reverse wrap-reverse`

### Flex Items

If you can imagine your flexbox container one of those [PEZ containers](https://www.google.com/search?q=pez+candy&tbm=isch), your flex items are the delicious little candy treats inside.  They flow in the direction of the pez container and are constrained to the container.

_The exception is text without a tag, i.e. `Just some text` vs `<span>I'm a flex item</span>`._

**Example**

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="QNReor" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="sturdynut" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut/pen/QNReor/">Flexbox Examples - Flex items</a> by Matti Salokangas (<a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut">@sturdynut</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

#### Alignment

##### align-self

`align-self` is the same as `align-content` but is just for a specific flex item.

![image](/images/posts/flexbox/flex-box-align-self.svg)

#### Flexibility

> The defining aspect of flex layout is the ability to make the flex items “flex”, altering their width/height to fill the available space in the main dimension. This is done with the flex property.

ref: [https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flexibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flexibility)

##### flex

Determines how a flex item will either grow or shrink based on the size of the flex container and the remaining space.

**Example**

* `flex: initial`, equivolent to `flex: 0 1 auto;`
* `flex: auto`, equivolent to `flex: 1 1 auto;`
* `flex: none`, equivolent to `flex: 0 0 auto;`
* `flex: [positive-number]`, equivolent to `flex: [positive-number] 1 0`

###### flex-grow

Determines how a flex item will grow relative to the other flex items in the container when there is additional space to distribute.

**Example**
<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="LNKEBP" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="sturdynut" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut/pen/LNKEBP/">Flexbox Examples - flex-grow</a> by Matti Salokangas (<a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut">@sturdynut</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

###### flex-shrink

Determines how a flex item will shrink relative to the other flex items in the container when there is additional space to distribute.  Flex-shrink is calculated by multiplying the flex-shrink value by the flex-basis (auto by default) when distributing negative space.

**Example**
<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="qZzEMW" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="sturdynut" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut/pen/qZzEMW/">Flexbox Examples - flex-shrink</a> by Matti Salokangas (<a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut">@sturdynut</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

###### flex-basis

Sets the initial size of the flex item prior to flex-grow and/or flex-shrink being applied.

**Example**
<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="VaJYVv" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="sturdynut" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut/pen/VaJYVv/">Flexbox Examples - flex-basis</a> by Matti Salokangas (<a href="http://codepen.io/sturdynut">@sturdynut</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

#### Ordering, Z-Index and visibility: collapse

##### order

* Flex items are ordered by the `order` modifier in place or the raw document order.

**Examples**

The items below would be displayed in reverse.

```
.item-1 {
  order: 3;
}
.item-2 {
  order: 2;
}
.item-3 {
  order: 1;
}
```
.item-3 would always be the first since it has a lower order than the default value of 0

```
.item-1 {
}
.item-2 {
}
.item-3 {
  order: -1;
}
```

##### z-index

* Z-index values will stack elements even if position is `static`.

##### collapse

* `visibility: collapse` will collapse a flex item affecting the containers main size, but will have no effect on the cross axis.

**Umm...WAT?**

This means that if you collapse a flex-item the width doesn't change, so it isn't jumpy.  However, `visibility: collapse` is expensive, so only use it when you need it.

#### Margins and Padding

* Margins of adjacent items do not collapse.
* Percentage margins and paddings should be avoided as they will get different behavior in different browsers.
* Auto margins expand to absorb extra space, which is awesome because you can use auto margins for alignment or to push items apart.

#### Minimum Size

A new value `auto` is now used as the initial value for `min-width` and `min-height`.  This provides an intuitive experience because your flex items will fit to the flex container by default.

#### Tips

There are some nuances of Flexbox you should be aware of, if you are accustomed to using `display: block`.

* `column-*` for multi-column layouts have no effect on a flex container.
* `float` and `clear` will not work
* `vertical-align` will not work
* `::first-line` and `::first-letter` will not work

If you look at the [browser support](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox) for Flexbox, we have full evergreen browser support. This means you can start using this now!

#### That's it!

Hopefully you have a better feel for flexbox.  If you want to dig into any of this deeper I recommend combing through the [official documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1).
