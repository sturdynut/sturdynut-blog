  I am a front-end developer from southern Oregon.  I love making beautiful things for the internet.
  In my spare time I work on <a href='http://github.com/sturdynut' target='_blank'>my projects</a> and
  share what I learn on my <a href='http://sturdynut.com/blog' target='_blank'>blog</a>.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://sturdynut.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
twitter_username: sturdynut
github_username:  sturdynut
